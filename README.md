# work-ds-curriculum-010-housing-price-in-mexico

## Purpose
A robust real estate market is essential for any economy. Understanding the factors that influence property values is crucial for both buyers and sellers. This project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate apartment prices based on key characteristics, such as location and size. This data science-driven analysis seeks to provide insights into the dynamics of the Mexican real estate market.

## Data
The data for this project, comprising property information, was obtained from publicly available sources. The data underwent rigorous preprocessing to remove inconsistencies and irrelevant information. After cleaning, the key features of interest include:

* Price
* Surface covered
* Latitude and longitude

The data cleaning process is meticulously documented in the project notebooks to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

## Usage
It is crucial to emphasize that this project serves solely as an educational exercise. The findings should not be directly applied to real-world investment decisions without thorough validation and independent verification.

## Conclusion
In summary, this project sought to leverage data science techniques to build a predictive model for apartment prices in Mexico. The project's outcomes provide valuable insights into the real estate market and can inform informed decisions regarding real estate investments. This project serves as a practical demonstration of the applications of data science in a real-world context.

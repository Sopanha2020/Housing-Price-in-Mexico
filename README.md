## Purpose
Any economy must have a real estate market, and both buyers and sellers can greatly benefit from knowing the variables that affect real estate values. The goal of this project is to develop a prediction model that calculates apartment pricing based on a number of characteristics, including location and surface covered. With a focus on predictive data science, this study seeks to shed light on the real estate market.

## Data
This project's data, which includes property information, was sourced from open sources. To eliminate any missing or unnecessary information, the data underwent pre-processing. Following the cleaning procedure, the primary columns of interest are as follows:

* Price
* Surface covered
* Latitude and longitude

To guarantee openness and reproducibility, the cleaning procedure was thoroughly recorded in the project notebooks.

## Usage
It is crucial to remember that this project is solely intended for instructional reasons and that decisions made in the real world should not be based on the findings without adequate validation and verification.

## Conclusion
To sum up, the goal of this research was to use data science methods to develop a forecast model for apartment pricing. The project's outcomes offer valuable perspectives on the real estate market and can be utilized to make well-informed choices on real estate investments. This project is an illustration of the practical applications of data science.
